A deskstop rack for homestudio in 19" rack format and 3U in height
The rack shelf is not sturdy enough without units inside of it, or pillars that can support it inside of the rack. 

Inside dimensions:
490mm ( 19" is 482mm ) 
210mm ( my Cinema Display=207mm )
134mm ( 133(3U) + 1mm(marginal) =  134 )
